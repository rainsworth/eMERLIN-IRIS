    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes the data reduction for MERLIN 5-GHz radio continuum observations of the radio galaxy 3C277.1. For more information see www.merlin.ac.uk.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data were taken using 6 antennas, Ca (32 m) and Mk Ta Da Kn De, all 25 m. Their sensitivities vary, with De being by far the least efficient at this frequency. The array contains baselines up to 217 km and a usable bandwidth of 13 MHz which has been combined in one channel, hence the data volumne is small and rapid to process (the e-MERLIN upgrade will provide 2 GHz bandwidth). All antennas are alt-az. All four polarizations (RR RR LR RL) are present. Antenna positions are geocentric, terrestrial E, N positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be downloaded from 3C277.1.MULTTB which is a multi-source file containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 3C277.1 (target)\n",
    "   - 1300+580 (phase-reference source and polarization leakage calibrator)\n",
    "   - 3C286 (primary flux scale calibrator and polarization angle calibrator)\n",
    "   - OQ208 (point source flux scale calibrator)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two flux scale calibrators are used because sources like 3C286 with stable, well-known amplitudes (and in this case polarization) are usually extended over several arcsec or more and hence are heavily resolved by MERLIN. On the other hand, point-like, bright sources like OQ208 are usually variable.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Information: If you want to short-circuit any of the steps, or compare your data (see if you can do better!), 3C277.1.FITS is a multi-source file containing target and calibration sources which has already been (mostly) edited. 3C277.1C.SPLIT contains the fully-edited target with all calibration from calibration sources applied, ready for imaging and self-calibration. 3C277.1.CAL.SPLIT is also fully self-calibrated and 3C277.1.FITSIMAGE is the final image in full polarization. These can be loaded into CASA using importuvfits for the first 3 files and importfits for the image.\n",
